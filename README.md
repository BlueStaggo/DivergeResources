# Minecraft Diverge Resources
This is the repository Minecraft Diverge uses to download its resources. Its resources are downloaded over official Minecraft resources provided by the official server and obtained through Betacraft. Hopefully, this is under fair use as Minecraft Diverge is a non-profit, free and open source Minecraft mod. Attribution can be found in the "resources.xml" file.
